Builds a parse tree of each controller using Java Parser. Then the dependencies are identified and copied across as needed. A design decision was made that dependency DTOs are copied rather than relying on their presence in a jar file.
The reason being that this approach will result in the code throwing an exception when a DTO in the Application Under Test get's changed.

In the context of Antikythera, AUT means Application Under Test rather than the name of the bitbucket project of which this is a part of.
